	Setting up this module is actually very simple.
	
	1. Put "DisableShiftLock" script into ServerScriptService.
	2. Put "CustomShiftLock" script into StarterPlayer>StarterPlayerScripts.
	
	And you're done!
	To customize the settings go to CustomShiftLock>SmoothShiftLock
	Then find "config" (Should be located at line 47.)

	After reading, delete this script and the thumbnail.
